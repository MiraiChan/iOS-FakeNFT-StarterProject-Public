# iOS-FakeNFT Marketplace

## Purpose and goals of the application ##

The app helps users browse and buy NFT (Non-Fungible Token). The purchasing functionality is simulated using a mock server.
The application's development is still in progress. UIKit and MVP were used in this project. The work was in a team of two, so I implemented only part of the project (Catalogue).

Application goals:

- viewing NFT collections;
- viewing and purchasing NFT (simulated);
- viewing the ratings of other users;
- view the user profile.

## Description of the application ##
- The application show a catalog of NFTs structured as collections.
- The user can view information about the collection catalog, the selected collection and the selected NFT.
- The user can add NFTs to favorites.
- The user can remove and add items to the cart and place the order (the purchase is simulated).
- User can view other users' rating and users' information.
- The user can view his profile, including information about favorites and NFTs owned by him.
